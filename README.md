# Ml-bucket
Ever gone through a situation where you are implementing a research paper and wish for some petty scripts which could have made your life easier?
Well, the aim of the repository is to bring all the appurtenances of ML (NLP/CV etc.) into one place and use them whenever you need them with a little tweak.
I have added some basic scripts and will add more in due time. 
1. **tf-idf.py** implements the standard tf-idf (term frequence - inverse document frequency) algorithm using sklearn (TfidfVectorizer), although you can use HashVectorizer for better speedup and scalability.
2. **SVM.py** implements Support Vector Machine algorithm on the data **train.csv**. The code first removes all the un-necessary features, converts the categorical/nominal features to numberical using one-hot encoding method and final training is done using LibSVM .
